  <h1>Dean Update 8/6/2015:</h1>

  <p>I had a long discussion with Satina about Dean's progress.  He's learning the PECS system so fast that she thinks we need to step it up.  Here is the plan she laid out and I think we should go for it.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Get duplicate cards for activities around the house. For example a 'Go Outside' card that is on the back door and an identical card in his card book that he must bring to us then match next to the card by the door.</li>
    <li>Where ever Dean goes the book goes with him</li>
    <li>Be consistent with using the cards at meal time especially. Everyone needs to get on board with encouraging Dean to communicate his needs. Re-enforcing this at meal times is very important since he is motivated to ask for things.</li>
    <li>Keep the picture book available to him and enforce communication with either clear words or the PECS cards.  Example: If he wants ipad he must clearly say ipad or get the ipad card.</li>
    <li>Organize Deans toys into themed bins in a shelf with PEC labels. This will allow him to match cards to what he wants to play with and get into a routine of putting toys away.</li>
  </ol>
